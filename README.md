# "Community Grant DAO" (Solidity)

## Description
A decentralized grant funding system for Black entrepreneurs, artists, and developers. The smart contract allows members to propose projects and vote on funding allocations using a DAO governance model.

## Key Features
- Token-Based Voting: Users receive governance tokens to vote on proposals.
- Proposal System: Entrepreneurs can submit funding proposals, and token holders vote.
- Fund Disbursement: Funds are released based on successful voting outcomes.
- Transparency: All transactions and votes are visible on-chain.

## Why This Matters
This project showcases Solidity skills in governance mechanisms and community-driven finance while reinforcing financial empowerment within underrepresented communities.

## Tech Stack
- Solidity (smart contract logic)
- Hardhat (development and testing)
- OpenZeppelin (ERC-20 and governance modules)
- Frontend (React + Web3.js for interaction)
